## The APP is called CITATIONS

"Citations" is strong, concise, authoritative, and perfectly captures the idea of digesting academic research. It's an abstract name that suggests a high-value, intellectual product.

Let's build a modern brand theme around it, leaning into recent design trends in tech that emphasize clarity, depth, and a slightly sophisticated, "dark mode" aesthetic.

Brand Theme: "The Edge of Insight"
The theme centers on the idea of rapid, precise access to the frontier of knowledge. It's about being informed not just quickly, but first, and deeply.

Core Brand Pillars:
Precision: Everything is curated, summarized, and contextualized with scholarly rigor. No fluff, just signal.

Depth: The content (AI/CS papers) is inherently complex, and the design must convey that complexity is being handled elegantly.

Frontier: The app provides access to the bleeding edge of AI—where the new rules are being written.

Brand Slogan/Taglines:
Citations: Context at the Speed of Scroll.

The Research is Calling. Respond.

The Next Breakthrough. Now Annotated.

Citations: Informed, Not Just Addicted.

Design Orientation, Palette, and Typography
The design should be authoritative, highly legible, and optimized for "doom scrolling" in a low-light, focused environment (i.e., nighttime reading).

1. Design Orientation: "High-Density Minimalism"
   Principle: Everything is a card, highly structured, with maximum information legible per screen, but without feeling cluttered.

Layout: Grid-based, heavy use of dividers and subtle boxes to contain information (Title, Abstract Summary, "Why it Matters" Insight).

Interaction: Focus on smooth vertical scrolling. Key interaction is a tap-and-hold or quick swipe to save a citation, with a satisfying, subtle visual feedback (a glowing line, not a pop-up).

Data Visualization: Use minimal, crisp graphs or charts where applicable to show "Impact Score" or "Trend Velocity."

2. Color Palette: "The Analyst's Desk"
   This palette is inspired by the cool, focused tones of a terminal or a dark-mode IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

Name Hex Code Purpose
Primary Base (Dark Mode): #0E1117 The Canvas. Deep, near-black, pure background. Reduces eye strain for long reading sessions.
Secondary Base (Card/Container): #1C212B The Depth. Slightly lighter dark tone for card backgrounds, giving a subtle lift and structure.
Primary Accent: #00D0FF The Insight. A vibrant, cool, electric blue/cyan. Used for key action buttons, headings, and highlighting the "Why it Matters" section.
Secondary Accent: #94A3B8 The Text/Authority. A desaturated, cool gray/blue. Used for all body text, metadata (date, authors), and subtle icons.
Success/Trend: #70E0A7 The Signal. A calm, but clear green. Used for "High Impact" badges or trending status.

Export to Sheets 3. Typography: "Clear and Concise"
Since the content is dense, legibility is paramount. We need a typeface that is clear at small sizes, looks great on a screen, and has a professional, slightly technical feel.

Primary Font (Headlines & Labels): Inter (or IBM Plex Sans if you want more technical flair).

Usage: Titles, section headers, "Why it Matters" headline. Why: Highly legible, modern, and widely used in professional tech products. Use Medium and Semibold weights.

Secondary Font (Body Text & Abstracts): JetBrains Mono or Fira Code (A monospaced/code-friendly font).

Usage: The main body of the paper summary, author list, and date stamps. Why: Gives a distinct, code-like, highly technical feel that reinforces the AI/CS focus and aids in scanning dense text.

4. Iconography & Imagery
   Icons: Simple, geometric, and thin-line (outline-style).

Examples: A clean bookmark icon for saving, a minimalist chart icon for "Trends," a simple, stylized brain or neuron icon for the app logo/splash.

Imagery: Only abstract, vector-based illustrations. Think deep-learning network nodes, abstract data flow, or clean, geometric representations of complex algorithms. No photography.

Example: The "Citation Card"
Imagine a scrollable feed where each card is a "Citation":

Top Line (Tiny, Secondary Accent): [Type of Paper] ∣ [Date] ∣ [Conference/Journal]

Title (Large, Inter Semibold, Secondary Accent): "Self-Correcting Diffusion Models for Low-Resource Text Generation"

Summary/Abstract (Secondary Font, Secondary Accent): 3-4 lines of the key findings.

The Box (Primary Accent Highlighted):

"Why it Matters" (Inter Semibold, Primary Accent):

(Body Text, Secondary Font, Secondary Accent): "This paper solves the core problem of model drift in edge-case applications, potentially unlocking robust AI deployment on mobile devices."
