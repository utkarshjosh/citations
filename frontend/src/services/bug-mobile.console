few mobile improvements in frontend 

there is lot of black gap between two scrolls ,we want them to be a single running thread, so easy you can just hold in the middle and see 3 posts connected ,like tiktok

coming back on top should be as easy as going down

mobile browser like chrome have pull down to refresh, prevent that  when we scroll backwards
