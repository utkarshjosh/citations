ðŸ”¹ Data Sources

arXiv CS categories (cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.CV, cs.NE, etc.).

(Future) PubMed â†’ if extending to AI-in-health.

(Future) SSRN â†’ AI-in-law/finance.

ðŸ”¹ Processing

Scraper â†’ get titles + abstracts daily.

LLM Summarizer â†’

Plain-English 3â€“5 line summary.

"Why it matters" (impact).

Potential applications (use-cases).

Optional ranking â†’ popularity, citations, or trending keywords.

ðŸ”¹ Delivery

Daily Digest Email (like TLDR newsletter).

Byte Feed (Inshorts style) â†’ mobile/web app.

Notification API â†’ Telegram/Slack/Discord bot for instant updates.

3. Features (MVP vs Later)
âœ… MVP (Lean scope)

Choose domain: Computer Science â†’ AI/ML/Robotics/Systems.

Daily curated digest (max 10â€“15 highlights/day).

Web landing page with public feed.

Email subscription.

ðŸš€ Future iterations

Personalization â†’ user can "like" topics, feed gets smarter.

Multi-vertical support (AI in healthcare, law, finance, etc.).

Team/workplace subscription (Slack integration).

Analytics: trending methods, hot topics, keyword clouds.

Premium tier: deep-dive summaries, visual explainers.

4. Micro-SaaS Angle

Free tier: public feed + 1 daily email.

Paid tier:

Custom digest (e.g., only NLP or only robotics).

Slack/Telegram bot.

Team subscription.

Growth loop: academic Twitter/LinkedIn share â†’ more signups.

5. Tech Stack (MVP-friendly)

Scraping: Python (arXiv API).

Summarization: OpenAI GPT / Llama + prompt engineering.

Backend: FastAPI / Go microservice.

Frontend: Next.js (like Inshorts).

Delivery: Email via Resend / Postmark.

Storage: Postgres (for papers, likes, personalization).

Example Digest (Inshorts style)

Paper: "Large Language Models as Zero-Shot Planners"
Summary: Researchers show LLMs can plan multi-step actions without explicit training.
Why it matters: Reduces need for costly supervised datasets.
Applications: Robotics, autonomous agents, workflow automation.

ðŸ’¡ The extent for now (to keep it micro and useful):

Stick to AI/CS papers only.

Deliver as byte feed + daily email.

Add minimal "like" button for future personalization.
