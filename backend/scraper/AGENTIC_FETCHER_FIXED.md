# Agentic Paper Fetcher - Fixed ✅

## Issue Resolved
The `agentic_paper_fetcher.py` was failing with error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'paper_search_mcp'
```

## Root Cause
The `paper-search-mcp` package (located in `/backend/paper-search-mcp/`) was not installed in the scraper's virtual environment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Installed paper-search-mcp package
```bash
cd /home/ongraph/CODE/self/brain-scroll/backend/scraper
source .venv/bin/activate
cd ../paper-search-mcp
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Fixed paper transformation
Updated `_transform_paper()` method in `agentic_paper_fetcher.py`:
- Changed `paper_dict.get("id")` to `paper_dict.get("paper_id")` (correct field name)
- Added parsing for semicolon-separated authors string
- Added parsing for semicolon-separated categories string
- Improved handling of updated_date field

## Current Status

### Database
- **Total papers**: 20
- **Processed papers**: 7 (with AI summaries)
- **Unprocessed papers**: 13

### API
- ✅ Returns all 20 papers
- ✅ Pagination working (7 pages with limit=3)
- ✅ Papers include AI-generated content where available

### Agentic Fetcher
- ✅ Successfully imports `paper_search_mcp.academic_platforms.arxiv.ArxivSearcher`
- ✅ Fetches papers from arXiv
- ✅ Transforms papers to correct schema
- ✅ Deduplication working (17 duplicates skipped in last run)
- ✅ AI processing working (4 papers processed in last run)

## Files Modified
1. `/backend/scraper/agentic_paper_fetcher.py` - Fixed transformation logic
2. Installed `paper-search-mcp` package in scraper's venv

## Next Steps
1. Run more fetches to get additional papers
2. Process remaining unprocessed papers
3. Re-enable `processed: true` filter in API once satisfied with content

## Usage
```bash
cd /home/ongraph/CODE/self/brain-scroll/backend/scraper
source .venv/bin/activate
python fetch_and_process_20.py
```

This will:
- Fetch ~21 papers (3 per category × 7 categories)
- Deduplicate against existing papers
- Process new papers through AI workflow
- Store in MongoDB with summaries, insights, and applications
