  "abstract": "\n        We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on \n        attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. \n        Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior \n        in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time \n        to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German \n        translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, \n        by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model \n        establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after \n        training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs.\n        ",
